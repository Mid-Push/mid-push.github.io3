I'm a fourth year Phd student at <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'> Carnegie Mellon University </a>, advised by <a href='https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/'>Prof. Kun Zhang</a>.

My research interests lie in general causality and machine learning. Currently, I focus on transfer learning from causal perspective. In partiular, I have been working on <i>image-to-image translation, paired image synthesis and domain adaptation </i>for several years. I also have a strong passion for generative models, e.g., <i>GAN</i>, <i>normalizing flow</i> and <i>diffusion models</i>.
