Hi! I'm a fourth year Phd student at <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'> Carnegie Mellon University </a>, advised by <a href='https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/'>Prof. Kun Zhang</a>.

My research interests lie in general causality and machine learning. Currently, I focus on transfer learning from causal perspective. In particular, I have been working on <b>image-to-image translation, paired image synthesis and domain adaptation </b>for several years. I also have a strong passion for generative models, e.g., <b>GAN</b>, <b>normalizing flow</b> and <b>diffusion model</b>.
